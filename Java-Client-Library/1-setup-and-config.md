# Configuration

---

There are 2 important files for configuring the Java Client Library in the Participant's application.
1. `client-config.properties` - for configuration of client parameters needed by the Java Client Library to communicate with PAPSS System.
2. `security.properties` - for configuration of keystore files and certificates used by the Participant's application.

These 2 properties configuration files must be present in the Participant's application's classpath.
Ideally in a Springboot application this will be in the /resources folder.
